#It is doing the calculation
# In the United States we use an acronym called PEMDAS which stands
# for Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition
# Subtraction. That's the order Python follows as well. The mistake
# people make with PEMDAS is to think this is a strict order, as in
# "Do P, then E, then M, then D, then A, then S." The actual order
# is you do the multiplication and division (M&D) in one step, from
# left to right, then you do the addition and subtraction in one
# step from left to right. So, you could rewrite PEMDAS
# as PE(M&D)(A&S)

#It is doing the calculation
print("Roosters", 100-25 * 3 % 4)
print("Now I will count the Eggs:")
#It is doing the calculation
How does % work?
# The way % works is, "X divided by Y with J remaining." For example,
# "100 divided by 16 with 4 remaining." The result of % is the J part,
# or the remaining part.

print("Is it Grater or Equal?", 5 >= -2)
print("Is it less or equal", 5 <= -2)
